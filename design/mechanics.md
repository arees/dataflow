# Dataflow Mechanics

## Main Mechanics:
- Computational power: Can be used to decrypt dataflows, mine datacoins, sending pishing attacks. Also needs to be allocated to hosting or your products will go offline and you will start to see angry customers processing you.
- Dataflows: Every tech company has a dataflow, wich is where all the "data" that the company has passes. (Data = Sites, apps, games, registers, digital stuff) ISP's can allocate some computational power to decrypt a tech company that uses then dataflow, but theres a risk of being discovered and you may get your butt kicked with processes.
- Datacoins: Every company has certain amount of datacoins, wich are like bitcoins. Every company also has a datacoin trust, wich is determined by processes & laws - Laws: Every region can pass laws in a law session. All laws have effects on tech companys or isps, like: Net Neutrality, ISP decryption bonus: 30% Law sessions will be totally randomized if no one does anything with it. You can try to bribe in a law session, so you use money to give a side more chances to win.
- Credentials
By decrypting dataflows, you have a chance of gaining credentials. Credentials can be used on pishing attacks or sold in the grey market for datacoins.
- Money
Theres the money money too, wich is used to bribe law sessions and build infraestructure. Money can be gained through exchanging datacoins (their value is like bitcoin value) or in case of ISP's gaining money through users.

## ISP mechanics:
- Coverage
ISP's start with certain coverage on the area, like 1%.
They can use money (theres a real money, the one that you can bribe laws with) to build infraestructure, wich adds certain user growth percentage to they.
More users, more money.
- Everything passes through then
ISP's can try to decrypt the dataflow of a company that uses then, having a chance of getting credentials.

## Developer mechanics:
- Service Services are like apps, they have certain popularity and need certain computing power to maintain, as well as some datacoin.
- Marketing Marketing takes certain datacoin amount and adds popularity to the selected service (depends on datacoin spent) }
